What are DBMS keys?

+ A DBMS Key is an attribute or a set of attributes which help you uniquely identify a record or a row of data in a relation(table).

WHAY we need DBMS keys?

+ For identifying any row of data in a table uniquely. 
+ We can force identity of data and ensure integrity od data is maintained.
+ To establish relationship between tables and identifying relationship between tables.

+ Types of DBMS Keys:
  -Super Key : It is nothing but a key which we just understood in the beginning.
         keys: SID, REG_ID, EMAIL, SID+REG_ID,REG_ID+EMAIL, EMAIL+SID, SID+REG_ID+EMAIL.    
               An attribute or a set attributes that can be used to identify row of data in a table is a super Key.
      
  -Candidate Key : It is nothing but minimal subset of super Key.
             Keys: SID,REG_ID,EMAIL 
                   If any proper subset of a super Key is a super Key then that key cannot be a candidate key. 

  -Primary Key   : The candidate key chosen to uniquely identify each row of data in a table
                   No 2 rows can have the same primary key value,primary key value cannot be NULL and every row must have a primary key.
           Keys  : SID,REG_ID,EMAIL
                 =====> if we choose REG_ID as primary key then SID and EMAIL will become Alternative key.            
  -Alternative Key

  -Foriegn Key   :It is an attribute in a table which is used to define its relationship with another table.
                  Using foreign key helps in maintaining data integrity for tables in relationship.

  -Composite & Compound Key : Any Key with more than one attribute is called Composite Key.
   In the above example(SID,REG_ID),(REG_ID,EMAIL),(EMAIL,SID),(SID,REG_ID,EMAIL) all are composite keys.
  
  -Surrogate key :If a relation has no attribute which can be used to identify the data stored in it, then we create an attribute for this purpose.
                  It adds no meaning to the data but serves the sole purpose of identifying rows uniquely in a table.
